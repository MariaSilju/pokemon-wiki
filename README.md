# Gjensidigmon

A Pokemon browsing app where you can search and explore Pokemon!

## How to Run

1. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. **Start the app**:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3. Open your browser to the URL shown (usually `http://localhost:5173`)

## How it Works

**Gjensidigmon** lets you discover Pokemon in two ways:

-   **Browse**: Scroll through all Pokemon in a grid layout with infinite scrolling
-   **Search**: Type in the search box to find specific Pokemon with autocomplete suggestions

Click on any Pokemon card to see detailed information including stats, abilities, moves, and high-quality artwork. The app uses the PokeAPI to fetch all Pokemon data.

Built with Vite, React 19 and TypeScript! Enjoy! âœ¨
